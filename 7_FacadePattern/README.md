1. The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsytem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
1. Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends. 
1. We should only invoke methods that belong to :
   - The object itself
   - Objects passed in as a parameter to the method
   - Any object the method creates or instantiates
   - Any components of the object

## Summary
1. Facade pattern is used to encapsulate a complicated system and make it easier than manipulating the system directly.
