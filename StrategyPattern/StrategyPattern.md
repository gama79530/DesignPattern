# Strategy Pattern

## Tips
1. Identifying the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
1. Programming to an interface, not an implementation.
1. Favoring composition over inheritance.
1. Defining a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Summary
1. Separating the difference between what stays the same and what varys needs experience.
